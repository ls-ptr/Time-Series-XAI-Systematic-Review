* Brainstorming for data and kategorization structure

** Approach by Nauta et al.

*** Paper Selection 
- Literature from 2014-2020
- 12 conferences
- Query: explain*|explanat*|interpret*
- Serach on 04.05.2021: 606 Results
- Without workshop papers and tutorials: 494
- After inclusion criterion 361: 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Original work introducing, applying, and/or evaluating one or more methods for explaining a machine
learning model.
#+END_QUOTE
- only papers that introduce a new xai technique: 312
  - the reduced 49 papers were still concidered for evaluation metrics

*** Categorization of the papers
There were 6 dimensions for paper categorization:
- Type of data (for us it will be time series only)
- Type of predictive model
- Type of method used for explanation
- Type of explanation
- Type of problem
- Type of task

*** XAI Explanation Quality Properties:
The authors defined 12 quality properties to be examined:
- Correceness
- Completeness
- Consistency
- Continuity
- Contrastivity
- Covariate complexity
- Compacteness
- Composition
- Confidence
- Context
- Coherence
- Controllability
